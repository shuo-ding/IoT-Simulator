# Realtime IoT MQTT Simulator - RIMSim by Dr Shuo Ding
----- APS.NET C#, simulate unlimited IoT sensors for generating big IoT data for real-time data analysis.

RIMSim is a realtime IoT sensor simulator based on MQTT protocol, with unlimited capacity of sending MQTT messages to the MQTT broker, per user defined. The simulator can be configured as "Sender", "Receiver", or "Transceiver" role as user desired. Simulation parameters can be easily configured by XML file, and simulation results will be stored as TXT file, and in SQLServer database, or Azure IoT Hub. A Power BI visualization dashboard is also provided to visualize the realtime statistics. In this source code and Power BI dashboard, I provide an example for sending simulated IoT data - Temperature, Humidity, AQI.   

RIMSim provides with you a great platform for developing applications with the requirement of integrating IoT networks in your project. Some examples may include: simulating IoT network attacking, simulating air quality IoT sensors in smart city scenario, simulating IoT sensors in smart car parking scenario, etc.
